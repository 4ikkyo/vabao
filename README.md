# Vabao
A landing page/showcase website created for a client, developed as part of a team project in 2023.  
The project was never officially launched as the client abandoned the business idea.

## My Contribution
- Full front-end development (HTML, SCSS, JS/jQuery).
- Gulp setup (build process, minification, live-reload).
- Implementation of interactive UI components (sliders, forms, animations).

## Original Project
Developed in collaboration with a team of 3:
- Front-end development (my role)
- Back-end development (planned but not implemented at this version)
- UI/UX design

## Project Structure
Brief description of the key directories and configuration files:
- `#src/` - editable source code (HTML templates, styles, scripts and assets)
- `dist/` - compiled production files generated by the build
- `gulpfile.js` - defines Gulp tasks used by `npm run start` and `npm run build`
- `package.json` - project metadata and npm scripts

## Development
Install dependencies and start the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run start
